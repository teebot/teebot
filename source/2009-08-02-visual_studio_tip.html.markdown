Among the best productivity tips we developers should follow first is this one: let's get our hands off that bloody mouse (we should make it a song and sing it along everyday but we would look silly at best).  
Of course, by default Visual Studio is full of keyboard shortcuts but adding your owns can be a huge benefit. Here's a few examples.  


### Get Rid of Those Tabs

How often do you find your favorite IDE cluttered with numerous tabs?  
Simply map a keyboard shortcut to the command `File.CloseAllButThis`.  

I mapped it to something I could easily remember: Ctrl+B, Ctrl+B as in "Bye Bye" tabs.  
It's a simple tip but it can save you **a lot of time**.

Of course you might still need to go back to the last two or three last opened tabs. To do this, I always have the *Undo Close* window at hand. Better yet, use bookmarks on your current investigations.  

### Quickly Duplicate a Line

Another shortcut you can often find in other IDEs but that is missing in VS is a combo for *Duplicate Line*.  

However since this command is not builtin, you have to add it as a macro (this is exactly what Christophe Herreman suggests in a [blog post](http://www.herrodius.com/blog/52)) or use it from the additonal commands provided by ReSharper:

**Disclaimer:** this one is to be used at your own risks as [copy/paste is dangerous for code reuse](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001257.html).  

### Notes

Once you have set your shortcuts to your taste do not forget to export your settings.  

To have a quick grasp of the VS builtin shortcuts, lots of people have compiled *cheat sheets* such as [NerdFortress's](http://nerdfortress.com/2008/09/02/visual-studio-2008-cheat-sheet/).
